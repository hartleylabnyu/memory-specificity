# Reinforcement learning increasingly influences memory specificity from childhood to adulthood
Tasks, anonymized data, and analysis code for: *Reinforcement learning increasingly influences memory specificity from childhood to adulthood*

## Tasks
We conducted two multi-session online experiments. In the first session of each experiment, participants completed a reinforcement-learning task in which either specific exemplars or broader stimulus categories determined the rewards associated with different actions. In the second session, which was administered one week later, participants completed a memory test in which we probed the specificity of their memories for the stimuli encountered during learning.

The tasks were coded in jsPsych version 6.3.1 and administered online via Pavlovia.

## Data
Cleaned data and parameter estimates from our fitted reinforcement-learning models can be found in the data folders within each experiment. 

## Analysis and computational modeling code
Data was analyzed in R using the R markdown analysis scripts found in the analysis folders. 
Computational model-fitting was conducted in Matlab (version 2020b). Modeling code is also located in the analysis folders.
